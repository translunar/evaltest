"Rapid change in the sequence of human olfactory receptor genes is most likely an example of which of the following types of selection?","Relaxed","Purifying","Positive",,"Negative","Purifying selection and negative selection are the same thing, so the answer is neither A nor D. Positive selection would suggest the environment demands greater olfactory capability, which is likely not the case for humans, who are decreasingly dependent on their sense of smell; and likewise, relaxed selection is most likely."
